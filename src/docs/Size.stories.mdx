# Spacing

These measurements should be used for margins, paddings and other small
size increments in order to maintain consistent layout across the application.
Custom sizes outside of this list are acceptible wherever these don't fit the bill.

<Story name="Spacing">
  <Sizes />
</Story>

## Spacing SASS

The predefined spacing values are accessed through the `size(size)`
(ex. size(xl)). The size parameter defaults to `m` if not passed.

```scss
.foo {
  margin: size(m);
  // This gives us the medium size
  padding: size();
  width: size(xxxl);
}
```

# Breakpoints

The following are the breakpoint dimensions used for responsive layouts.
Generally you should use a mobile first approach to these breakpoints so you
would first define the moble styles and then override them in a breakpoint
definition.

<Story name="Breakpoints">
  <Breakpoints />
</Story>

## Breakpoint SASS

To use the webpage breakpoints, you should use the `@include breakpoint-up(m)` mixin.
You can pass the breakpoint size as the parameter and any styles that you want
to use at that breakpoint as the mixin content.

```scss
.foo {
  // This is the mobile size:
  width: size(m);

  // Anything above the small point should
  // be wider.
  @include breapoint-up(s) {
    width: size(xl);
  }
}
```

# Border Radius

The following border radius sizes are available.

<Story name="Border Radius">
  <Radii />
</Story>

## Border Radius SASS

To access the border radii, you can use the `radius(size)` function.

```scss
.foo {
  border-radius: radius(m);
}
```

# Layers

The layers define the `z-index` of various components.

The available layers are (lowest to highest):

<Story name="Layers">
  <ol>
    <li>behind</li>
    <li>normal</li>
    <li>above</li>
    <li>floating</li>
    <li>header</li>
    <li>tooltip</li>
    <li>modal</li>
  </ol>
</Story>

## Layers SASS

To set the `z-index` of elements, we use the `layers(name)` function.

```scss
.header {
  z-index: layer(header);
}

.toolTip {
  z-index: layer(tooltip);
}
```
