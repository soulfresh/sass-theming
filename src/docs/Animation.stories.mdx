# Animation

Most animations in this project are generated using CSS `transition` and `animation`.
In situations where CSS animations aren't viable, the
React Spring library is used (https://www.react-spring.io/). Generally,
CSS animations are favored because they should run faster and
are easier to maintain.

Below are examples of the available animation speeds:

<Story name="Animation Speed">
  <AnimationSpeed />
</Story>

## Animation SCSS

To access the animation properties from the theme, you can use the
`speed(speed)` and `ease(name)` functions. These can be used with both
"transition" and "animation" properties.

```scss
.foo {
  transition: margin-right speed(m) ease(out-hard);
}

.bar {
  animation: some-anim speed(l) ease(out);
}
```
