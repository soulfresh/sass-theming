# Measurements

In addition to colors, themes can include values for measurements
such as paddings/margins, break points, radius values and 
z-index layers.

Measurement palettes are all Named Palettes which you access through
convenient functions like `break-point()` and `radius()`.

The following sections will walk through the measurements provided
for the default `light` and `dark` themes out of the box.
