# Icon Sizes

The `icon-size()` function can be used to size icons or other elements
to a set of s/m/l sizes. This is useful to help maintain consistent icon
sizing across your project.

Here's an example:

```css
@import 'theme';

/* This is my Card component SASS */
.card {
  /* Large measurements that are not used in many places
     can be hardcoded or global variables */
  width: 300px;
  /* Or you could base a size off of the theme so things
     line up nicely */
  width: size(l) * 10;
  /* But paddings and margins would use the theme in order
     to maintain consistent alignment across the project. */
  padding: size(m);
}
```

## Default Size Values

Here are the sizes that come out of the box.

## size() function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `key` | A key in the `$palette-size` map. |
| __Return__ | `number` | A CSS px value |


## size() setup

You can override or modify the `$palette-size` SASS map in order to
specify your own sizes. You don't have to use the s/m/l naming convention
but it's recommended.

```css
/* Override the size palette. */
$palette-size: (
  default: $s-m,
  xxxxl: $s-xxxxl,
  xxxl : $s-xxxl,
  xxl  : $s-xxl,
  xl   : $s-xl,
  l    : $s-l,
  m    : $s-m,
  s    : $s-s,
  xs   : $s-xs,
  xxs  : $s-xxs,
  xxxs : $s-xxxs,
  card-width: $card-width,
  pin-width: $pin-width,
);

/* Now import the theme which will configure the theme functions */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

Here's how you can modify the default sizes.

```css
/* Import the palette definitions */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';

/* Use map-set to set individual keys in the palette. */
map-set($palette-size, m, 22px);

/* Now import the theme which will configure the theme functions */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```
