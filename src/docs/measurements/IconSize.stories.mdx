# Icon Sizes

The `icon-size()` function can be used to size icons or other elements
to a set of s/m/l sizes. This is useful to help maintain consistent icon
sizing across your project.

Here's an example:

```css
@import 'theme';

/* This is my Card component SASS */
.card {
  /* Large measurements that are not used in many places
     can be hardcoded or global variables */
  width: 300px;
  /* Or you could base a size off of the theme so things
     line up nicely */
  width: size(l) * 10;
  /* But paddings and margins would use the theme in order
     to maintain consistent alignment across the project. */
  padding: size(m);
}
```

## Default Size Values

Here are the sizes that come out of the box.

## size() function

## Configuration

The icon size palettes are available through the `icon-size`
property of each theme.
