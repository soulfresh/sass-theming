# Breakpoints

Breakpoints are usually accessed through the `breakpoint-up()` mixin that allows
you to create breakpoint media queries. Under the hood, breakpoints
are a Named Palette and are available through the `breakpoint()` map.

## Default Size Values

The following are the breakpoints defined out of the box.

## breakpoint-up() mixin

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `key` | A key in the `$palette-breakpoint` map. |
| `content` | `CSS` | The CSS content to render at the given breakpoint. |
| __Return__ | `media query` | A media query with the given content. |

To use the breakpoints, you would generally use the `@include breakpoint-up(m)` mixin.
You can pass the breakpoint size as the parameter and any styles that you want
to use at that breakpoint as the mixin content.

```css
.foo {
  /* This is the mobile size */
  width: 200px;

  /* Anything above the medium breakpoint should be wider. */
  @include breapoint-up(m) {
    width: 300px;
  }
}
```

## breakpoint() function

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `size` | `key` | A key in the `$palette-breakpoint` map. |
| __Return__ | `number` | The width value for the breakpoint in question. |

Should you need the raw breakpoint width, you can access it as follows.

```css
.foo {
  /* Make the width exactly match the medium breakpoint width. */
  width: breakpoint(m);
}
```

## breakpoint() setup

Both the `breakpoint-up()` mixin and the `breakpoint()` function use
the same map under the hood. It is just a Named Palette and can be
customized in the same way as other palettes.

```css
$palette-breakpoint: (
  default: 0,
  xs: 360px,
  s:  576px,
  m:  768px,
  l:  992px,
  xl: 1200px
);

/* Now import the theme which will configure the theme functions */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```
