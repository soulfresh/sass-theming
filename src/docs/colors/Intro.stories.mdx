# Colors

Colors can be broken down into Named Palettes and Numbered Palettes.

**Named Palettes** have values that are accessed using a memorable
name that describes how the value should be used. For example, the `foreground`
palette includes colors like `text` and `light-text`. Palettes are
simply a SASS Map object.

**Numbered Palettes** have values that are accessed using a hue
number that describes how dark or light the color is. These palettes provide
a range of hues based around a single color. For example, the `primary`
palette includes 10 colors with shades ranging from `50` (lightest)
to `900` (darkest). Palettes are simply a SASS Map object.

**Themes** are a collection of palettes. For example, this library provides
`light` and `dark` themes out of the box. As you might expect, the light theme
provides dark text and foreground values paired with light background values.
The dark theme is the inverse of that. Your project can have as many themes
as you want to define. Themes are simply a SASS Map object with palette maps
as their properties.

## Default Theme Structure

By default, themes include the following palettes.

- `theme`: You can have as many color themes as you like. This project comes
           with `light` and `dark` themes.
  - `foreground`: A Named Palette of foreground colors with names like `light-text` and `border`.
  - `background`: A Named Palette of background colors with names like `hover` and `shaded`.
  - `gradient`: A Named Palette of reusable gradient definitions with names like `light` and `primary`.
  - `shadow`: A Named Palette of reusable shadow defintions with names like `card` and `overlay`.
  - `primary`: A Numbered Palette of 10 primary colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `secondary`: A Numbered Palette of 10 secondary colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `grayscale`: A Numbered Palette of 10 grayscale colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `focus`: A Numbered Palette of 10 focus colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `success`: A Numbered Palette of 10 success colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `warn`: A Numbered Palette of 10 warn colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `error`: A Numbered Palette of 10 error colors gradiented from light to dark.

You can define as many color themes as your project needs and then use them
through the color functions exposed in the following sections.

Each theme can include whatever palette objects you want it to have. However,
it is recommended (but not required) that all of your themes provide the same
palettes so your code will remain agnostic to the theme it is using.
