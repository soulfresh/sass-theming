# Basic Color Variables

For the most part, all values in the theme are configured through SCSS maps
but there are several non-map variables you can use directly. These variables
are used to influence the overall coloring of all the default theme colors.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$black` | `#000` | All default colors based on black. This includes most foreground colors in the light theme and background colors in the dark theme. |
| `$white` | `#FFF` | All default colors based on white. This includes most foreground colors in the dark theme and background colors in the light theme. |
| `$focus` | `#4a7ddc` | A color used to derive the focus palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$primary` | `#4a7ddc` | A color used to derive the focus palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$secondary` | `#e0a92d` | A color used to derive the secondary palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$success` | `#44b151` | A color used to derive the success palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$warn` | `#e3b526` | A color used to derive the warn palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$error` | `#dd3d37` | A color used to derive the error palette if you don't specify your own version of that palette. |
| `$font-size-unit` | `1px` | The unit for font-size values. |
| `$size-unit` | `1px` | The unit used for size values. |
| `$animation-speed-unit` | `1ms` | The unit used for animation speeds. |

For example, if you wanted your text colors and the grayscale palette to be lightly
tinted with your primary brand color, you could set `$black: mix($my-brand-color, #000, 95%)`.

## Usage

To use these variables, define them before you import anything from this
library.

```css
/* Define these variables first */
$black: #000;
$white: #fff;
$focus: #ff00ff;
$font-size-unit: 1pt;
$size-unit: 1rem;
$animation-speed-unit: 1s;

/* Now you can import the default variables and helpers. */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/util';

/* Configure your theme here... */

/* Import the theming infrastructure that provides
   the convenience functions used to access the themes. */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```
