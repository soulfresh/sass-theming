# Basic Color Variables

For the most part, all values in the theme are configured through SCSS maps
but there are several non-map variables you can use directly. These variables
are used to influence the overall coloring of all the default theme colors.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$black` | `#000` | All default colors based on black. This includes most foreground colors in the light theme and background colors in the dark theme. |
| `$white` | `#FFF` | All default colors based on white. This includes most foreground colors in the dark theme and background colors in the light theme. |
| `$focus` | `#4a7ddc` | Any colors used to represent focused state. |

For example, if you wanted your text colors and the grayscale palette to be lightly
tinted with your primary brand color, you could set `$black: mix($my-brand-color, #000, 95%)`.
