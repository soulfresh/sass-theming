# Introduction

`@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides a set of simple SASS
tooks you can use to create and use themes in
your SASS based projects. The main goal of these functions
is to make it dead simple for developers to consistently use
theme values without memorizing specific variable names or
pixel/color values.

Unlike most theming tools, `@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` themes
are not limited to theming colors but include all aspects
of your design such as font families, font sizes, margins, etc.

## Using Your Theme

Here's a quick example of using a theme.

```css
.my-component {
  /* The foreground() function gives you access to
  common text, border and other foreground element
  colors. Colors are accessed by a memorable name
  that describes the purpose for that color. */
  color: foreground(light-text);
  /* The background() function gives you access to
  common colors for backgrounds behind text. */
  background-color: background(shaded);
  /* The font-family() function gives you access
  to the main genres of font families used in your
  application such as title, body, code, etc. */
  font-family: font-family(title);
  /* The font-size() function gives you access
  to the various font sizes used in your app
  using small/medium/large type names so
  developers do not need to remember the exact
  font size values used in your designs. */
  font-size: font-size(l);
  /* There are multiple functions that use the
  small/medium/large naming convension such as
  border radii. You also have the ability to use
  other naming convensions that better suit your needs. */
  border-radius: radius(m);
  /* These functions are easy to use in shortcut
  css properties. */
  border: 1px solid foreground(border);
}

.my-other-component {
  /* In addition to the foreground and background
  color palettes, you can have as many gradiated
  color palettes as you like ala Google Material Palettes. */
  background-color: color(primary, 200);
}
```

## Setting Up Your Theme

Creating a new theme is pretty simple. The theme
consists of a set of SASS map objects containing the theme values.
Those maps are accessed through memorable convenience functions.
You can have full control over the names and values in your theme
but `@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides reasonable defaults
for all of them as well.

The following chapters discuss in depth how to setup and use
your theme but here's a quick example of how you migh customize
the border radius values of your theme.

`_theme.scss`
```css
/* Radii is the map exposed through the radius() function.
Define it before you load @thesoulfresh/sass-theming and
it will overwrite the default values. */
$radii: (
  s: 2,
  m: 5,
  l: 10,
);

@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

`my-component.scss`
```css
/* Import _theme.scss with your theme definitions. */
@import 'theme';

/* And then use your theme settings... */
.my-component {
  border-radius: radius(m); /* outputs --> border-radius: 5px; */
}
```

You also have the option of updating the existing theme maps
if you only want to change a few values in them.

`_theme.scss`
```css
/* Start by importing the theme maps */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';

/* Then change the specific values you want */
map-set($radii, m, 8);

/* Or add new values to an existing map */
map-set($adii, xxxxxxxxl, 10000000);

/* Then import the theme */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

## General Structure

There's nothing magic to this library. It is really just a wrapper
around SASS maps and some convenience functions for accessing values
on those maps. It also pulls most of it's practices from Material Design
without forcing you to use Material Design.

You can easily implement your own version of this library in your own
project by using `map-get()` to access properties in your own custom
maps. However, since I found myself repeating that
work across multiple projects, I've exposed a simple way to get
it up and running quickly in new projects.

## TODO

Move color generator helpers into a file that can be imported separately.
Add documentation for:
- Install
- SASS Path
- Adding keys to the theme
- Adding more themes

## Let's Get Started

The following sections will walk you through all of the available
theme functions and details on getting your theme setup.
