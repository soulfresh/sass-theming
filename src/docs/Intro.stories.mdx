# Introduction

`@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides a set of simple SASS
functions you can use to create and use theme variables in
your SASS based projects. The main goal of these functions
is to make it dead simple for developers to constently use
theme values without memorizing specific variable names or
pixel/color values.

## Using Your Theme

Here's a quick example showing how easy it is to use
your theme.

```css
.my-component {
  /* The foreground() function gives you access to
  common text, border and other foreground element
  colors. Colors are accessed by a memorable name
  that describes the purpose for that color. */
  color: foreground(light-text);
  /* The background() function gives you access to
  common colors for backgrounds behind text. */
  background-color: background(shaded);
  /* The font-family() function gives you access
  to the main genres of font families used in your
  application such as title, body, code, etc. */
  font-family: font-family(title);
  /* The font-size() function gives you access
  to the various font sizes used in your app
  using small/medium/large type names so
  developers do not need to remember the exact
  font size values used in your designs. */
  font-size: font-size(l);
  /* There are multiple functions that use the
  small/medium/large naming convension such as
  border radii. You also have the ability to use
  other naming convensions that better suit your needs. */
  border-radius: radius(m);
  /* These functions are easy to use in shortcut
  css properties. */
  border: 1px solid foreground(border);
}

.my-other-component {
  /* In addition to the foreground and background
  color palettes, you can have as many gradiated
  color palettes as you like ala Google Material Palettes. */
  background-color: color(primary, 200);
}
```

## Setting Up Your Theme

Creating a new theme is pretty simple. The theme
consists of a set of SASS map objects containing the theme values.
Those maps are accessed through memorable convenience functions.
You can have full control over the names and values in your theme
but `@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides reasonable defaults
for all of them as well.

Here's an example of how you can specify the border radius
values for your theme.

`_theme.scss`
```css
/* Radii is the map exposed through the radius() function.
Define it before you load @thesoulfresh/sass-theming and
it will overwrite the default values. */
$radii: (
  s: 2,
  m: 5,
  l: 10,
);

@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

`my-component.scss`
```css
/* Import _theme.scss with your theme definitions. */
@import 'theme';

/* And then use your theme settings... */
.my-component {
  border-radius: radius(m); /* outputs --> border-radius: 5px; */
}
```

## TODO

Move color generator helpers into a file that can be imported separately.
Add documentation for:
- Merging custom palette with existing palette
- Adding keys to the theme
- Adding more themes

theme functions and details on getting your theme setup.
