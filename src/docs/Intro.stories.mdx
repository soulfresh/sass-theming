# Introduction

`@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides a set of simple SASS
tooks you can use to create and use themes in
your SASS based projects. The main goal of these functions
is to make it dead simple for developers to consistently use
theme values without memorizing specific variable names or
pixel/color values.

Unlike most theming tools, `@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` themes
are not limited to theming colors but include all aspects
of your design such as font families, font sizes, margins, etc.

## Using Your Theme

Here's a quick example of using a theme.

```css
.my-component {
  /* The foreground() function gives you access to
  common text, border and other foreground element
  colors. Colors are accessed by a memorable name
  that describes the purpose for that color. */
  color: foreground(light-text);
  /* The background() function gives you access to
  common colors for backgrounds behind text. */
  background-color: background(shaded);
  /* The font-family() function gives you access
  to the main genres of font families used in your
  application such as title, body, code, etc. */
  font-family: font-family(title);
  /* The font-size() function gives you access
  to the various font sizes used in your app
  using small/medium/large type names so
  developers do not need to remember the exact
  font size values used in your designs. */
  font-size: font-size(l);
  /* There are multiple functions that use the
  small/medium/large naming convension such as
  border radii. You also have the ability to use
  other naming convensions that better suit your needs. */
  border-radius: radius(m);
  /* These functions are easy to use in shortcut
  css properties. */
  border: 1px solid foreground(border);
}

.my-other-component {
  /* In addition to the foreground and background
  color palettes, you can have as many gradiated
  color palettes as you like ala Google Material Palettes. */
  background-color: color(primary, 200);
}
```

## Getting Started

```sh
$ npm install @thesoulfresh/sass-theming
```

### SASS includePaths

We recommend setting the `includePaths` for your version of SASS
to include the root of our source directory. This way you
can easily include your theme in all of your files using
something like `@include 'theme';`.

Here's how you set your include paths in [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)

### Theme File

Create a `_theme.scss` file in the root of your SASS path
where you can configure the theme. It should look something
like this:

```css
/* Start by importing the default light and dark theme objects */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';
/* And utilities to help generate palettes */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/util';

/* Your customizations go here... */

/* Import the theming infrastructure that provides
   the convenience functions used to access the themes. */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

## Setting Up Your Themes

Creating a new theme is pretty simple. The theme
consists of a set of SASS map objects containing the theme values.
Those maps are accessed through memorable convenience functions.
You have full control over the names and values in your theme
but `@thesoulfresh/sass-theming` provides reasonable defaults
for all of them as well.

### Definitions

**Palettes** are a collection of values related to a specific use.
For example, themes provide multiple color plattes but also provide
non-color palettes like sizing palettes and font family palettes.

**Themes** are a collection of palettes. For example, this library provides
`light` and `dark` themes out of the box. As you might expect, the light theme
provides dark text/foreground values paired with light background values.
The dark theme is the inverse of that. Your project can have as many themes
as you want to define. Themes are simply a SASS Map object with palette maps
as their properties.

**Named Palettes** have values that are accessed using a memorable
name that describes how the value should be used. For example, the `foreground`
palette includes colors like `text` and `light-text`. The `size`
palette provides margin/padding sizes using names like `s` (small), `m` (medium),
etc.

**Numbered Palettes** have values that are accessed using a hue
number that describes how dark or light the color is. These palettes provide
a range of hues based around a single color. For example, the `primary`
palette includes 10 colors with shades ranging from `50` (lightest)
to `900` (darkest). Palettes are simply a SASS Map object.

### Default Theme Structure

By default, themes include the following palettes.

- `theme`: You can have as many themes as you like in your project. This library
           provides `light` and `dark` themes by default.
  - `foreground`: A Named Palette of foreground colors with names like `light-text` and `border`.
  - `background`: A Named Palette of background colors with names like `hover` and `shaded`.
  - `gradient`: A Named Palette of reusable gradient definitions with names like `light` and `primary`.
  - `shadow`: A Named Palette of reusable shadow defintions with names like `card` and `overlay`.
  - `primary`: A Numbered Palette of 10 primary colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `secondary`: A Numbered Palette of 10 secondary colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `grayscale`: A Numbered Palette of 10 grayscale colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `focus`: A Numbered Palette of 10 focus colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `success`: A Numbered Palette of 10 success colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `warn`: A Numbered Palette of 10 warn colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `error`: A Numbered Palette of 10 error colors gradiented from light to dark.
  - `font-family`: A Named Palette of font families named by their usage (ex `title`, `body`).
  - `font-size`: A Named Palette of font sizes named using s/m/l naming convention.
  - `font-weight`: A Named Palette of font weights named by their weight (ex. `bold`, `medium`).
  - `size`: A Named Palette of small sizes that are useful for margin/padding spacing named using the s/m/l convention.
  - `radius`: A Named Palette of border radius sizes using the s/m/l naming convention.
  - `layer`: A Named Palette of z-index values named for their usage (ex. `above`, `tooltip`, `modal`).
  - `breakpoint`: A Named Palette of page breakpoint sizes named using the s/m/l convetion.
  - `icon-size`: A Named Palette of icon sizes named using the s/m/l convention.
  - `speed`: A Named Palette of animation speeds named using the s/m/l convention.
  - `ease`: A Named Palette of animation easing curves named as `ease-out`, `ease-in-hard`, etc.
  - `is_dark`: A boolean value specifiying whether this is a dark theme.

### Configuring The Default Themes

The following chapters discuss in depth how to setup and use
your theme but here's a quick example of how you might customize
the border radius values of the default light theme.

`_theme.scss`
```css
/* Start by importing the default light and dark theme objects */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/util';

/* Define the overrides you want to apply to all themes */
$overrides: (
  /* Override the "radius" map of each theme */
  'radius': (
    's': 2,
    'm': 5,
    'l': 10,
  ),
  /* You can also add or override keys to existing palettes */
  'size': map-merge(
    map-get($theme-light, 'size'),
    ('xxxxxxxxxl': 1000000000)
  ),
);

/* Set your values on the light and dark themes */
$theme-light: map-merge($theme-light, $overrides);
$theme-dark: map-merge($theme-dark, $overrides);

/* Import the theming infrastructure that provides
   the convenience functions used to access the themes. */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

`my-component.scss`
```css
/* Import _theme.scss with your theme definitions. */
@import 'theme';

/* And then use your theme settings... */
.my-component {
  border-radius: radius(m); /* outputs --> border-radius: 5px; */
}
```

### Adding More Themes

You can define as many color themes as your project needs. Each theme can include whatever
palette objects you want it to have. However,
it is recommended that all of your themes provide the same
list of palette names so your code will remain agnostic to the theme it is using.

Here's how you can add a new theme and specify a convenience function
for accessing it.

`_theme.scss`
```css
/* Start by importing the default light and dark theme objects */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/variables';

/* Define the overrides you want to apply to all themes */
$theme-pink: (
  /* Override the "primary" map of each theme */
  'primary': make-palette(#ff00ff),
);

/* Use the light theme to provide the rest of the palettes
   on the pink theme. */
$theme-pink: map-merge($theme-light, $theme-pink);

/* Provide easy access to the primary palette of the pink theme. */
@function pink($hue: 500) {
  @return theme-value($theme-pink, 'primary', $hue);
}

/* Import the theming infrastructure that provides
   the convenience functions used to access the themes. */
@import '@thesoulfresh/sass-theming/theme';
```

`my-component.scss`
```css
/* Import _theme.scss with your theme definitions. */
@import 'theme';

/* And then use your theme settings... */
.my-component {
  background-color: pink(500);
  /* You can also use the `theme-value` function to
     access theme values if you don't want to create
     convenience functions. */
  background-color: theme-value($theme-pink, 'primary', 500);
}
```

### Theme Helpers

You can use the helper functions defined [here](/?path=/docs/utils-theme-helpers--page)
to help you generate your themes.

## General Structure

There's nothing magic to this library. It is really just a wrapper
around SASS maps and some convenience functions for accessing values
on those maps. It also pulls most of it's practices from Material Design
without forcing you to use Material Design.

You can easily implement your own version of this library in your own
project by using `map-get()` to access properties in your own custom
maps. However, since I found myself repeating that
work across multiple projects, I've exposed a simple way to get
it up and running quickly in new projects.
